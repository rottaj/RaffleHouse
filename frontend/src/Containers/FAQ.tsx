                                    RaffleHouse is the First-ever NFT Raffle House, secured with blockchain 
                                    technology.Our website uses completely transparent random generation algorithms 
                                    to ensure our siteâ€™s winners are truly random on all of our raffles. Players 
                                    can sign up with just a metamask and can start entering as many raffles as 
                                    they would like at no cost, besides the slot price and any gas fees associated 
                                    with the transactions. Hosts can set up a raffle for any NFT they own* and 
                                    choose their own slot price and amount of slots, with a 10% commission fee 
                                    towards the website.
